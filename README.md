Project Title: Quakemon
A mod which incorporates Pokemon inspired gameplay into Quake 4. 
Once you load in the game and press lets go, instead of selecting difficulty, you are going to select the starter mon you will begin with. As you look through the options, a brief overview of how to play is shown on the side, which I will go over now.

How to Play:
Mon Gun:
  The starting pistol which is the blaster has been changed to be called a Mon Gun. By shooting with no charge, you can spawn in wild mons which you can battle or catch, clearing the monster and spawning a new one with each click. If you do a charged shot with no wild
  mons around, you can spawn in your caught mon which begins as the starter you chose. If you do a charged shot with another monster around, you begin the turn based battle phase of this game. Note, a normal shot will clear and spawn a new wild monster, with or without one around. 

Turn Based Battle Phase: 
  Once you are in the turn based battle phase, shown by the "Battle Start" on the top left, you can either catch, fight, or run from the wild monster.
  Catch:
  Catching is simple, all you need to do is a charged shot with your Mon Gun to the mon you are in battle with. Then, everything will be cleared and they will be your mon, the next time you send a mon out it will be that mon you caught. Your previous mon would be replaced
  by this one since you can only have one mon at a time, but you can switch them as much as you like. 

  Fight:
  On the bottom left of your screen, you can see your mon's health, and on the top right of the screen, you can see your opponent's health. On the top left, you can then see text of what move you just did and what move the opponent just did. You can choose from 4 moves which 
  are represented as guns. Simply switch to the move you wish to use as the guns are named after them, and shoot to do the move. The 4 moves are:
  
  Tackle - a normal attack which just subtracts some health from the opponent.
  Protect - a defensive attack which protects you from the next attack your opponent throws. 
  Swords Dance - a supportive attack which increases the amount of damage you do to the opponent.
  Growl - a attack which decreases the amount of damage your opponent does to you. 

  Each time you use a move, the opponent then also uses one of these four moves on you, and this will all be shown in the text on the top left of the screen. The fight will continue until one of the mons runs out of health. If they lose, you get a win and it gets added onto
  your win total, if you lose, you need to reload at a save next to the medic so they can tend to your mons.

  Run:
  If you are in the turn battle phase and don't want to fight, just shoot the mon gun normally and everything will clear as if you ran away. 

Medic, Win Shop and Items:
  Medic: 
  The medic is there to always heal your mons up if they get hurt. If you ever lose a battle, you will load up to the medic since they are healing you. If your mons are just weak, you just go up to the medic and either stand next to them, or click them if necessary, where
  they will heal your mon back to full health.

  Win Shop:
  The medic loves to see their patients be victorious, so they sell you items just for the price that you have to gain wins. Each time you gain a win, your win count will go up, and the medic seeing this as they heal you will give you an item to try out in your next battle. 
  Keep getting wins so you can try all the items!

  Items:
  There are 5 items which you can get from the medic. You get 1 after each win, with the final 1 being at win 5. Keep in mind, while items are powerful, they let opponents attack you twice since you have to focus to use them. 
  They are also represented as guns like the moves. Just select the item you'd like to use (the guns are renamed after them), and shoot to use the item. 
  Win 1:
  Protection Breaker: This item takes away the ability for a mon to use Protect for the rest of the fight.
  Win 2:
  Will Breaker: This item greatly lowers the attack of the opposing mon.
  Win 3:
  Attack Enhancer: This item greatly increases the attack of your mon.
  Win 4:
  Gemini Split: This item lets your mon do an attack worth twice the damage. 
  Win 5:
  Olympic Mead: This item heals your mon to double it's normal health.

After getting all of the items, you are free to gain as high a win score as you want, fighting and catching as many mons as you would like! 

Your grand adventure in the Strogg region awaits!
